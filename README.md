Todd Kridel's Project 3 Application Assignment: an Art Online Gallery and Store Webpage

## Overiew

* GitHub repository and README description information: https://github.com/Todd-Kridel/todd-artwork-gallery

* GitHub Pages published still-picture webpage: https://todd-kridel.github.io/todd-artwork-gallery/

* Heroku site published active application: https://todd-artwork-gallery.herokuapp.com/

The application assignment was quite-challenging...with all of its interrelated files and folders and interfaces. That extra difficulty sensation could be a result of end-of-class angst or the results of more-complex system features...or both. There was definitely a focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) concerns and organizational/efficiency concerns, and frequent-backup concerns, and stylization concerns, and modularity concerns, and re-usability concerns, and navigation path concerns, and data flow concerns...and asking-for-help concerns, and time management concerns, and prioritization concerns, and life-balance concerns, and life-focus/direction/goal concerns, and etc. This assignment was a good success and failure for the conclusion of the bootcamp course program.

## Assignment Requirements and Characteristics

* Use React for the front end.
* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
~ Use queries and mutations for *retrieving, *adding, ~updating, and ~deleting data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Include authentication (JWT).
* Protect sensitive API key information on the server. (Heroku Configuration Variables)
* CSS Styling that is -mostly- other than Bootstrap. Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions: Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-components and Emotion. Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design. Or alternatively create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.
- Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you donâ€™t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.
- Bonus: Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
 * Uses a web manifest
 * Uses a service worker for offline functionality
 * Is installable
Application fulfills all three of the requirements of a PWA: uses a web manifest, uses a service worker for offline functionality, is installable.
* Bonus 10 points: Application solves an immediate problem in any team member's job 
--
Repository has a unique name 2 points
Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions 2 points
Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc. 2 points
Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages 2 points
Repository contains quality README with description, screenshot, link to deployed application 2 points
--
Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate 5 points
Application user interface style is clean and polished 5 points

I unfortunately was not able to complete all of the GraphQL CRUD operations because my entire last tutoring session was spent at attempting to resolve several Heroku deployment problems. For the 2 CRUD functions (Update and Delete) that I did not complete...I at least was able to textually and button-ly and scroll-ly simulate their functionality in the application. To my benefit though in an offset way...I think that my project qualifies for the 10 bonus points of being immediately beneficial for the job situation of a team member (me). That is because I now want/have to focus more on my art production efforts and sale efforts to try to make more of a living/income at it--more than the hobby that it usually has been. That change in job path has occurred as a result of this bootcamp burning me out of my goal/hope/dream about becoming a professional/paid computer programmer. :) :( I think that my application has fulfilled (at least minimally) all/most of the other requirements that were listed for the project assignment.


## Directions for Future Development 

* Personal Profile Pages
* Art Supply Records
* Mapping Feature for Sales Location Tracking
and Art-Creation/Inspiration Locations
* Multiple-User
* Art/Picture Categories
* Email System
* Life Message Board
* Picture Posting By Users
* User Account Management

## Installation and Setup

There are not any special installation and setup steps for using the application because it is a full-stack application that is web-published to the Heroku website hosting system. For cloning the application files to a local computer...then a GitHub user account and GitHub Online Help documentation (installation procedures and configuration procedures) are necessary. The application can be accessed at the URL that is provided at the beginning of this document.

## Usage

Still pictures of the application can be viewed at the project-associated GitHub Pages published webpage that is at the URL that is provided at the beginning of this document.

1. View the general non-secured access that is non-secured (no logon).

2. Create a user account.

3. Log-on.

4. Log-off.

5. View the art gallery and general information.

6. View the art detail information.

7. Navigate around the various button-access routes. View the various
elements of conditional display (based on logon/logoff status and
navigation path status).

8. Access the Contact page by the 2 different methods. Test the 
validation processes of the form fields.

9. Attempt to add a comment about an artwork.

10. Attempt to update a comment about an artwork.

11. Attempt to delete a comment about an artwork.

## Credits 

* Continued informational and cognitive struggle and persistence were required.
